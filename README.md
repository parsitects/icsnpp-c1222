# ICSNPP-C12.22

Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - ANSI C12.22 traffic over TCP and UDP.

## Overview

ICSNPP-C12.22 is a Zeek plugin (written in [Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/)) for parsing and logging fields used by the ANSI C12.22 protocol as presented in IEEE standard 1703-2012, defining a transmission format for utility end device data tables or control elements.

This parser produces the following log files, defined in [scripts/main.zeek](scripts/main.zeek):

By Default:
* `c1222.log`
* `c1222_user_information.log`
* `c1222_service_error.log`

Optional:
* `c1222_authentication_value.log`
* `c1222_identification_service.log`
* `c1222_read_write_service.log`
* `c1222_logon_security_service.log`
* `c1222_wait_service.log`
* `c1222_dereg_reg_service.log`
* `c1222_resolve_service.log`
* `c1222_trace_service.log`

For additional information on this log file, see the *Logging Capabilities* section below.
Note that even the default logs have optional toggles to disable them - they are just enabled by default.

## Installation

### Package Manager

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html). It requires [Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/) and the [Zeek Spicy plugin](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/zeek.html).

```bash
$ zkg refresh
$ zkg install icsnpp-c1222
```


If this package is installed from ZKG, it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -NN`. If installed correctly, users will see `ANALYZER_C1222_TCP` and `ANALYZER_C1222_UDP` under the list of `Zeek::Spicy` analyzers.

If users have ZKG configured to load packages (see `@load packages` in the [ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)), this plugin and these scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.

## Logging Capabilities

### C12.22 Summary Log (c1222.log)

#### Overview

This log summarizes, by packet, ANSI C12.22 frames transmitted over 1153/tcp or 1153/udp to `c1222.log`. 
This log is **enabled** by default. Users can disable it by appending `C1222::log_summary=F` to the `zeek` 
command on the command line or by adding `redef C1222::log_summary = F;` to the `local.zeek` file.
The port can be overriden by redefining the `c1222_ports_tcp` and `c1222_ports_udp` variables, respectively, e.g.:

```
$ zeek -C -r c1222_tcp.pcap local "C1222::c1222_ports_tcp={ 40712/tcp }"
```
